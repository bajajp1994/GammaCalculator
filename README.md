**Function 5: Gamma Function**

This function is divided into 2 parts:
1) For Integer value
2) For Real Value

Definition: It acts like a factorial operation from positive integers to real and even complex values of the argument.

Formula Used to calculate gamma function
Γ(a) = (a-1)! for all positive Integers I+  
Γ(a) = infinity for all negative integers I- as well as 0  
Γ(a) = ∫∞ 0 t^(a−1)*exp(−t)dt, Re(a)>0  
  
In general:
**Γ(a+1) = aΓ(a)**
**Γ(a) =∫∞ 0 t^(a−1)*exp(−t)dt, Re(a)>0**
**Γ(1/2) =√π**
**Γ(a)Γ(1−a)=π/sin(πa)**
          
Domain:
Gamma function is defined for all Real Numbers excluding negative integers and 0.

Codomain:
It ranges from -infinity to infinity
